# Task-5---Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

Summary- 
The dataset contains 418 rows and 2 columns: PassengerId and Survived.

No missing values were found in this dataset.

The ‘Survived’ column shows how many passengers were predicted to survive:

152 passengers are marked as survived (1)

266 passengers are marked as not survived (0)

Approximately 36% of the passengers in this dataset were predicted as survivors.

Since this is only a submission file with IDs and outcomes, it does not contain features (like age, sex, fare) needed for detailed EDA, trends, or correlations.
